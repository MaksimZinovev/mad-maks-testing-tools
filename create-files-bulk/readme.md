Save this script to a file, for example create_files.sh, and make it executable with the following command:

`chmod +x create_files.sh`

Then you can run the script with:

./create_files.sh

This will create a .txt file for each name listed in names.txt. If names.txt contains:

myname

The script will create a file named myname.txt. Let me know if you need any more help!
